# Profile Searcher

- I have created a hybrid search retrieval system to find linkedIn profiles
- It filters based on hard-criterias(must haves) and soft-criterias(good to have)

## Getting Started
- Type the following commands in the terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/AdityaUnal/profileSearcher.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- .env file
```
TURBOPUFFER_API_KEY=tpuf_xxxx
VOYAGE_API_KEY=pa-xxxx

```
